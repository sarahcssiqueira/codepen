# My Codepen Profile

CodePen is an online community for build, testing, and discovering front-end code. Is focused primarily on front-end languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and preprocessing syntaxes that turn into those things.

It is a social development environment for front-end designers and developers and works as an online code editor and open-source learning environment, where developers can create code snippets, called "pens," and test them. 

I personally use this amazing tool to get inspiration and practice new CSS skills, buttons, gradients, etc when I have some spare time.
